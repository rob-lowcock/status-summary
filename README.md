# Service Status

A tool for displaying the status of multiple services at once. We rely on quite a few different external services at work, so this app is designed to collate the status of all the various services and display them in a single page.

**This is very much an alpha at the moment, and the code is generally horrible**

A Procfile is included in case you want to run this in Heroku

## Todo
* Unit tests ðŸ˜±
* Re-organise the api package
* General code tidying
* Add an example of the ping class being used
* Add GitHub monitor
